# SampleTodos

This project's a sample of works with TODOs.

## Backend 

The backend is on the `local-server` directory and it's implemented on [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/). It's very simple and it's implemented without any database, the data is initialized at the start of the backend.

To start the backend, you need to move to the `local-server` directory and run `npm install` or `npm i` and when the dependencies installation is finished run the `npm run start` command in a terminal.


## Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6. and I use the components `standalalone` new feature.

To run the project, first, we need to install the dependencies, `npm install` and run the project when this is finished `npm run start`. It's very important to run each project in a console.

## Structure of the project.

The project is separated on two directories:

* __core__: the general clases.
* __todos__: the components to make the todo list.
